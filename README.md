## 📋 What is vphone-cli?

vphone-cli lets you run a virtual iPhone using Apple's Virtualization framework. It boots iOS 26 on a virtual machine. This tool helps you explore iPhone features or test apps without a physical device. Its research VM infrastructure from PCC powers the virtual environment.

> **Personal note:** I forked this primarily to experiment with iOS 26 app testing on my M2 MacBook Air. Works well for my use case so far.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your Mac meets these needs:

- macOS version 13 or higher (Ventura or newer)
- Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2 series) or Intel with virtualization support
- At least 16 GB RAM (8 GB may work but performance will be poor)
- 10 GB of free disk space
- Virtualization.framework enabled by default in macOS

This app does **not** work on Windows or Linux currently. It requires macOS due to Apple's virtualization technology.

## 🔧 Features

- Boots virtual iPhone models with iOS 26
- Uses Apple's native Virtualization.framework for efficiency
- Supports multiple iPhone firmware variants
- Provides patch variants for different security levels
- Designed for app testing and iPhone environment simulation
